This database is a quantitative summary of the published literature on the diets of bird species. 

## Interactive Website  

This website ([https://aviandiet.unc.edu](https://aviandiet.unc.edu)) allows users to explore the most up-to-date database information, and to generate basic summaries by diet or prey item.

## R Package
A developmental **R package** is available [here](https://github.com/ahhurlbert/aviandietdb) for exploring, summarizing, and filtering the database in the R environment.

Note that the `dietdb` database object loaded with this package may be slightly out of date relative to the `AvianDietDatabase.txt` file in this repository.

## Data Entry  

Instructions for entering and cleaning new diet data information can be found [here](instructions/instructions.md).

Did you find an error in the database? Do you know of a published study with quantitative diet information that is not included in our database?
