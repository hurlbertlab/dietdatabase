Instructions for Data Entry
===========================

This repository is the temporary home for the Avian Diet Database being built
by the Hurlbert Lab at the University of North Carolina.    

The goal is to organize all available information (from published studies, gray literature, etc) on the diets 
of North American birds in its rawest form possible with the idea that this may be a resource for a broad 
range of ecological questions.

These data are automatically incorporated into the Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) database.
See [http://www.globalbioticinteractions.org](http://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/index.html) for more details.

## Finding Diet Data
We are focusing our search for diet data in the published literature. References related to avian diets have been scraped
from individual species accounts on the [Birds of North America website](http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/), and are
provided in the file 'NA_avian_diet_refs.txt'. For each species, look up the listed references to see if they contain
raw diet data summaries. If you were able to look up the reference, put a 'y' in the 'checked' column. If the reference was 
unavailable (couldn't access it online, not in the library) put a 'n'. For those that you checked, indicate (y/n) whether it
contained diet data in the 'useable_data' column.

_*NOTE*_: Place pdfs of all papers you find with usable data in the following folder on the HurlbertLab drive:
*HurlbertLab > Databases > DietDatabase > Papers with data*. The file should be saved with the last name of the author(s) and the year. 
For example, "Beaver and Baldwin 1975.pdf" or "Hurlbert et al 2007.pdf".

After you have examined all of the references listed in this table for a given species, you will perform a literature search
to see if any additional papers have been published on the diet of this species since the Birds of North America species
account was published or last revised (the year in the "revised" column). 

### Web of Science search
Go to [Web of Science](http://apps.webofknowledge.com) and in the Topic search box enter:  

```
"[common name]" AND (diet OR foraging OR food)
```
replacing [common name] with the actual common name of the species you are searching.

Click on +Add Another Field, and select Year Published. Search all years since the last revised date for that species as listed in the 
'NA_avian_diet_refs' table.    

Look up the papers in the search results, and be sure to add any that contain useful data to the NA_avian_diet_refs.txt table.

## Data Entry Details
When you've found a study with quantitative diet data, open the file 'AvianDietDatabase_template.txt' in Excel and re-save it, replacing
the word 'template' with the study author and year, e.g. 'AvianDietDatabase_Beaver_and_Baldwin_1975.txt'. Then proceed to enter as
much of the information described below as you can ascertain from the study.

To maximize the utility of the data, we need to record many types of information describing the what, when, where, and how 
of its collection, and so our database has many fields. In the table below we explain what exactly is characterized in each
of these fields, and how data should be entered. Further instructions about how to enter data in the database are provided 
[here](https://github.com/hurlbertlab/dietdatabase/blob/master/instructions/training_instructions.md).

    degrees. Do this by adding up the degrees, the minutes/60, and the seconds/3600. E.g., 89 + 30/60 + 15/3600. Lastly, 
    all longitudes west of the prime meridian (e.g. in North America) are NEGATIVE, so be sure to put a minus sign in front!</td>

For example, if stomach contents are broken down separately for two different individual birds collected at the same time and same place, then for bird #1, all records for Analysis_Number would be 1, and for bird #2, all records would have Analysis_Number 2. NOTE: For most studies, there will be only one "analysis" per combination of location, habitat, month, year, season, Study_Type and Diet_Type which means that usually Analysis_Number will just be 1 for those records.</td>

    <td>Suborder to which the prey item belongs. This field will most frequently be used when older studies report prey orders 
    "Homoptera", "Hemiptera", and "Heteroptera", which now all fall under the Order Hemiptera. An older (pre-2000s) report of "Hemiptera" should be classified as Order Hemiptera, Suborder Heteroptera. Any report of Homoptera classically referred to either aphids, psyillids, and whiteflies (now Order Hemiptera, Suborder Sternorrhyncha) or to leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers, and cicadas (now Order Hemiptera, Suborder Auchenorrhyncha). In some cases, there may be clues in the text that suggest which of these suborders is being referred to when the authors use "Homoptera". If there are no clues as to suborder, then the prey should be listed as Order Hemiptera, Inclusive_Prey_Taxon = "yes" (if there is no other Hemiptera entry in the diet), or Order Hemiptera, Inclusive_Prey_Taxon = "no" (if there _is_ a separate entry for Order Hemiptera, Suborder Heteroptera).</td>

    <td>Inclusive_Prey_Taxon</td>
    <td>Does the % diet data listed correspond to the importance of the listed prey taxon inclusively defined ("yes") or only for an unstated subset of the listed prey taxon ("no"). For example, let's say some diet items are identified to various families within Coleoptera, while some diet items are listed as "Unidentified Coleoptera" with the family unknown. In this case, we would have separate lines for the families "Tenebrionidae" and "Carabidae" for which <i>Inclusive_Prey_Taxon</i> would be "yes", but we might also have a line that identifies only down to Order Coleoptera for which <i>Inclusive_Prey_Taxon</i> would be "no" because the value in this row does not represent the fraction of the diet made up of all Coleoptera, only the Coleoptera that were not assigned to other groups. <b>Use this field rather than ever entering "Unidentified" or "Unknown" in any of the prey taxonomic rank fields.</b></td>

  <tr>
    <td>Prey_Name_ITIS_ID</td>
    <td>The Integrated Taxonomic Information Service (ITIS) taxon ID associated with the prey item. This field should be left blank and will be populated by an R script automatically.</td>

    <td>Prey_Name_Status</td>
    <td>Taxonomic status of the prey name, filled in automatically by R clean_all_names() function. "Verified" indicates the name matched a valid ITIS ID. "Unverified" means the name did not match a valid ITIS ID and needs to be investigated further.
    "Accepted" means the name did not match a valid ITIS ID, but investigation revealed that it reflects an accepted taxonomic entity not in ITIS. For "accepted" names, Prey_Name_ITIS_ID will be NA.</td>

    <td>Prey_Stage</td>
    <td>The lifestage of the identified prey item (e.g., 'adult', 'egg', 'juvenile', 'larva', 'nymph', 'pupa', 'teneral'). In general, you only need to worry about this column if the information is explicitly provided in the data source. <b>BUT NOTE: Always specify 'adult' or 'larva' for the Prey_Order "Lepidoptera" if you can figure it out.</b></td>

  <tr>
    <td>Prey_Part</td>
    <td>The part of the prey species represented in the diet if only a part was (likely) consumed. Especially for plant-based
    diet items, e.g., 'bark', 'bud', 'feces', 'flower', 'fruit','gall', 'oogonium', 'pollen', 'root', 'sap', 'seed','spore', 'statoblasts', 'vegetation'.</td>

    <td>Diet_Type</td>
	<td>Use one of 4 possible terms: <b>Wt_or_Vol</b>: Fraction of the diet as measured by weight or volume. E.g., all beetles in the stomach 
    contents were weighed, and this value was divided by the mass of all stomach contents. <b>Items</b>: Fraction of the diet as
    measured by a count of the number of prey items. E.g., the number of beetles in the stomach contents were counted, and this 
    value was divided by the total number of unique prey items in the stomach contents. <b>Occurrence</b>: Fraction of the birds examined that contained at least one individual of this prey type. <b>Unspecified</b>: Fraction of the diet of the prey item based on a
    methodology unspecified by the authors.</td>

## Other tasks

### Version control
We use a version control system called Git to manage so that we can easily go back to previous states, it's automatically
backed up, and many people can access it and add records simultaneously from different computers.

See [this page](instructions/git_dietdatabase_help.md) for instructions on how to use Git to manage the Avian Diet Database.

### Data cleaning
See [this page](cleaning/cleaning_overview.md) for instructions on cleaning newly entered data.

### Summarizing data
Use the `dbSummary()` function to get summary statistics for the diet database as a whole.
