## How to work with the Avian Diet Database on your own machine

1. Make sure you have both [R](https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed on your machine.  
2. Open RStudio.  
3. File > New Project > Version Control > Git. In the “repository URL” paste the URL of the Avian Diet Database GitHub repository. https://github.com/hurlbertlab/dietdatabase/.
* Do you NOT see an option to get the Project from Version Control? Make sure RStudio can find Git.
4. Decide where to store the local directory for the Project. Don’t scatter everything around your computer - have a central location, or some meaningful structure. 
5. I suggest you check “Open in new session”, as that’s what you’ll usually do in real life.
6. Click “Create Project” to create a new sub-directory, which will be all of these things:
* a directory on your computer  
* a Git repository, linked to a remote GitHub repository  
* an RStudio Project  
7. You should now be able to operate just as you have from the lab computers.
